# PreProcessing
Techniques and Solutions used during Pre-processing.

Data preparation takes 60 to 80 percent of the whole analytical pipeline in a typical machine learning project.

A key task when you want to build an analytic model using machine learning, is the integration and preparation of data sets from various sources like files, databases, BigData, sensors or social networks. This step can take up to 80 percent of the whole analytics project.

Datasets are different and they posses unique characteristics and taming and reshaping them for use in ML are always challenging.

Data preprocessing is an important step of solving machine learning problem. Most of the datasets (inputs) arriving at ML area requires to be cleansed and transformed to get qualified to be used in Machine Learning algorithms.

**Data PreProcessing = Data Cleansing + Feature Engineering**

Let's explore Feature Engineering.

## Feature Engineering 

Feature Engineering selects the right attributes to analyze. Use domain knowledge to select or create attributes that make machine learning algorithms work better. Feature Engineering process includes:

- Brainstorming or testing of features
- Feature selection
- Validation of how the features work with your model
- Improvement of features if needed
- Return to brainstorming / creation of more features until the work is done

Let's explore `Feature Selection`.
